Description: This script implements a FruitTree class that represents a fruit tree 
which is capable of producing certain maximum number of fruits per day when the 
suggested watering frequency per week is followed. If the watering frequency is 
more or less than the suggested frequency, then the number of fruits produced by 
the tree every day falls down. The number of fruits produced by a tree is proportional 
to its health where health can vary from 0.0 to 1.0 (where 1.0 means perfect health). 
The health of a tree is 1.0 when the watering done during the last one week is the same 
as suggested. The health goes down in a linear fashion becoming 0.0 if the watering 
frequency is 0 or if the watering frequency is double of the suggested watering 
frequency.
